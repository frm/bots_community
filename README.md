# Beware of the Software: Community

This is a repo for the community of the [Beware of the Software][bots]
screencast. **Ask questions, clarify any doubts you have, make requests or give
feedback here.** Just open a new issue and have at it

---

I have a general idea of some topics I want to go through, but I'm very open
to suggestions. **If you have any, this would be the place to do so. Just open
an issue and ask away.**

I'm also keen on diversifying the range of subjects,
besides Elixir. I have some thoughts on computational and topics that would
focus on different programming languages (or not focus in any in particular).
**Don't shy away from making requests because of the programming language.** The
language is just a tool.

**This is also the best place to ask questions on the screencast, particular
episodes, request more examples, etc.**

Feel free to ask anything, really!

Cheers,
Mendes
